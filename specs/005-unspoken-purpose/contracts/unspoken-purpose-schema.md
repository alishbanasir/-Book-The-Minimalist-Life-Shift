**Feature**: 005-unspoken-purpose
**Purpose**: Define validation schema (quality gates) for Chapter 5 content delivery
**Date**: 2025-12-03

---

## Gate 1: Constitutional Compliance (Must Pass First)

**Purpose**: Verify chapter adheres to all 4 constitutional principles before structural/functional validation

### Principle I: TONE - POSITIVE & MOTIVATIONAL

- [ ] **T-001**: Opening acknowledges disconnection from meaning WITHOUT dwelling on "wasted life" or "meaningless existence"
- [ ] **T-002**: Framework reframes routine as opportunity (not burden)
- [ ] **T-003**: Language empowers ("you're already building legacy") vs. shames ("you've been living purposelessly")
- [ ] **T-004**: Closing reinforces reader capability to live purposefully through small actions

**Validation Method**: Manual read-through checking for negative framing, dwelling on past failures, or language suggesting reader has "wasted time"

---

### Principle II: STYLE - SIMPLE & CONCISE

- [ ] **S-001**: Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level: 7-9 (8th-grade target)
- [ ] **S-002**: No self-help jargon ("authentic self", "soul's calling", "manifest destiny", "higher consciousness", "spiritual awakening")
- [ ] **S-003**: Metaphors use everyday references (waking mid-routine, finding thread, drops filling cup—NOT abstract concepts)
- [ ] **S-004**: Vocabulary conversational (no "existential", "transcendent", "actualize", "embody")
- [ ] **S-005**: Scannable format: clear headings, short paragraphs (3-4 sentences max), bold step names

**Validation Method**:
- Run text through readable.com or hemingwayapp.com (target: Grade 8 or lower)
- Manual scan for jargon/complex vocabulary
- Visual check for paragraph length and formatting

---

### Principle III: KNOWLEDGE - ACTIONABLE

- [ ] **A-001**: Reader can identify their unspoken purpose within 10 minutes after reading (no life coach, journaling app, or vision board session required)
- [ ] **A-002**: Reader can apply SEE-CONNECT-RECOGNIZE technique to one mundane task within 5 minutes
- [ ] **A-003**: Action steps are numbered, specific, and time-bound
- [ ] **A-004**: Technique requires only mindful awareness (no external tools mentioned)
- [ ] **A-005**: Examples are concrete and relatable (morning coffee, work email, dishes, bedtime routine—NOT abstract scenarios)

**Validation Method**:
- User testing: Give chapter to reader, ask them to identify purpose in 10 minutes and connect one action within 5 minutes
- Check for external tool references (journals, apps, coaches, vision boards, meditation retreats)

---

### Principle IV: LENGTH - FOCUSED

- [ ] **L-001**: Total word count ≤500 words (hard limit)
- [ ] **L-002**: Opening Hook: 50-75 words
- [ ] **L-003**: SEE section: 75-85 words
- [ ] **L-004**: CONNECT section: 75-85 words
- [ ] **L-005**: RECOGNIZE section: 75-85 words
- [ ] **L-006**: Action Steps: 100-150 words
- [ ] **L-007**: Closing: 25-50 words

**Validation Method**: Word processor word count tool

---

## Gate 2: Structural Requirements (Pass After Gate 1)

**Purpose**: Verify chapter follows mandated 4-part structure with proper formatting

### Hook Structure

- [ ] **STR-001**: Opening acknowledges reader completing tasks but feeling disconnected from meaning
- [ ] **STR-002**: Reframes purpose as already present (not requiring discovery)
- [ ] **STR-003**: Word count within 50-75 words

---

### Core Teaching Structure

- [ ] **STR-004**: **SEE the Small Action** section present with:
  - [ ] Bold name
  - [ ] Metaphor (waking mid-routine or similar)
  - [ ] Why (simple rationale in 1-2 sentences)
  - [ ] How (3-step process)
  - [ ] Example (concrete task)

- [ ] **STR-005**: **CONNECT to Your Unspoken Purpose** section present with:
  - [ ] Bold name
  - [ ] Metaphor (finding thread or similar)
  - [ ] Why (simple rationale)
  - [ ] How (ask "How does this serve what I value?")
  - [ ] Example (same task with connection articulated)

- [ ] **STR-006**: **RECOGNIZE You're Building Legacy** section present with:
  - [ ] Bold name
  - [ ] Metaphor (drops filling cup or similar)
  - [ ] Why (legacy built through small actions)
  - [ ] How (acknowledge "this is how I show up")
  - [ ] Example (legacy framing for same task)

- [ ] **STR-007**: Core sections total 225-255 words (within budget)

---

### Action Steps Structure

- [ ] **STR-008**: Action steps clearly numbered (1, 2, 3, 4)
- [ ] **STR-009**: Each step implementable within 5 minutes total
- [ ] **STR-010**: Steps follow logical flow: identify purpose → see task → connect → recognize
- [ ] **STR-011**: No tools/apps/journals required
- [ ] **STR-012**: Action steps within 100-150 word budget

---

### Closing Structure

- [ ] **STR-013**: Reinforces reader capability to live purposefully NOW (not someday)
- [ ] **STR-014**: Empowering tone (not motivational platitudes)
- [ ] **STR-015**: Within 25-50 word budget

---

## Gate 3: Functional Requirements (Pass After Gate 2)

**Purpose**: Verify all functional requirements from spec.md are satisfied

### Core Technique Requirements

- [ ] **FR-001**: Clear technique for connecting daily actions to purpose/legacy (SEE-CONNECT-RECOGNIZE taught explicitly)
- [ ] **FR-002**: Simple explanation of "unspoken purpose" provided (values/impact already guiding life)
- [ ] **FR-003**: Distinction between grand missions and simple purposes (not requiring world-changing ambitions)
- [ ] **FR-004**: 2+ concrete examples of mundane actions with purpose connection (morning coffee, work email, dishes, bedtime routine)

---

### Implementation Requirements

- [ ] **FR-005**: Numbered action steps implementable within 5 minutes
- [ ] **FR-006**: Positive language without suggesting readers "wasted time" or "lived without purpose"
- [ ] **FR-007**: 8th-grade vocabulary (Flesch-Kincaid 7-9)

- [ ] **FR-009**: 4-part structure (Hook → Core → Actions → Closing)
- [ ] **FR-010**: ≤500 words total
- [ ] **FR-011**: Empowering closing reinforcing reader's ability to live purposefully through small actions
- [ ] **FR-012**: No jargon ("authentic self", "soul's calling", "manifest destiny", "higher consciousness")
- [ ] **FR-013**: Tool-free (mindful awareness sufficient, no journals/apps/coaches)

---

## Success Criteria Validation (Post-Delivery Testing)

**Purpose**: Measure reader outcomes against spec.md success criteria

### Comprehension & Recall

- [ ] **SC-001**: 90%+ readers can recall SEE-CONNECT-RECOGNIZE technique immediately after reading (quiz or verbal explanation)
- [ ] **SC-002**: Chapter readable in <5 minutes (timed reading test with 10 readers)
- [ ] **SC-005**: 90%+ readers comprehend core concept (8th-grade reading level validated)
- [ ] **SC-008**: Core concept scannable in <2 minutes (timed scan test with headings/bold/examples only)

---

### Application & Meaningfulness

- [ ] **SC-003**: 85%+ readers feel daily routine more meaningful after reading (survey: "Do you feel your daily tasks are more connected to your larger purpose after reading this chapter?")
- [ ] **SC-004**: Readers connect at least one mundane action to purpose within 5 minutes (timed exercise: "Pick a daily task and connect it to your purpose using the technique")
- [ ] **SC-007**: 85%+ readers feel more connected to sense of purpose (survey: "Do you have a clearer understanding of what you value and how your daily actions serve those values?")
- [ ] **SC-009**: 90%+ readers identify their unspoken purpose within 10 minutes (exercise: "Name what you care about most—that's your unspoken purpose")
- [ ] **SC-010**: 85%+ readers apply technique without external tools (survey: "Were you able to apply the technique using only your awareness, without journaling or other tools?")

---

### Engagement

- [ ] **SC-006**: 80%+ readers complete chapter without dropping off (reading analytics or survey: "Did you read the entire chapter?")

---

## Validation Workflow

**Execution Order**:

1. **Gate 1 (Constitutional)**: Run first. If ANY item fails, stop and revise before proceeding.
2. **Gate 2 (Structural)**: Run after Gate 1 passes. Check structure, formatting, word budgets.
3. **Gate 3 (Functional)**: Run after Gate 2 passes. Verify all spec requirements satisfied.
4. **Success Criteria**: Run after delivery (user testing phase).

**Failure Handling**:
- Gate 1 failure → Immediate revision (constitutional violations compromise entire chapter)
- Gate 2 failure → Structural fix (rewrite sections to fit structure/budget)
- Gate 3 failure → Functional fix (add missing examples, clarify technique, adjust language)
- Success Criteria below target → Iterative improvement (enhance clarity, examples, or delivery)
