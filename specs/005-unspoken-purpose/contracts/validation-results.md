## Edge Case Review

### Edge Case 1: Reader lacks clear purpose
**Addressed**: ✅ Step 1 guides: "Name what you care about most—family, creativity, service, learning"

### Edge Case 2: Actions conflict with purpose
**Addressed**: ✅ CONNECT section: "Don't force positivity if the connection isn't real" (acknowledges some tasks may not connect)

### Edge Case 3: Routine offers no connection
**Addressed**: ✅ Implicitly handled by "Find the authentic link" (not forcing connections)

### Edge Case 4: Legacy language intimidating
**Addressed**: ⚠️ Partial - Uses "legacy" throughout but frames it accessibly ("how you're remembered", "impact you leave")
**Recommendation**: Consider if "impact" language could supplement "legacy" in future revision

---

## Metaphor Clarity Check

- [x] **SEE**: "waking up mid-routine" - everyday, relatable ✅
- [x] **CONNECT**: "finding the thread" - simple, visual ✅
- [x] **RECOGNIZE**: "drops filling a cup" - concrete, observable ✅

All metaphors use everyday references (not abstract concepts).
