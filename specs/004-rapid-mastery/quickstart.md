---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin writing, ensure you have:
- ✅ Read and understood [spec.md](spec.md) (functional requirements)
- ✅ Read and understood [data-model.md](data-model.md) (framework structure)
- ✅ Read and understood [research.md](research.md) (rationale and examples)
- ✅ Access to [contracts/rapid-mastery-schema.md](contracts/rapid-mastery-schema.md) (quality gates)
- ✅ Text editor with word count capability
- ✅ Readability checker (readable.com or hemingwayapp.com)

---

## Writing Process (10 Steps)

### Step 1: Set Up Word Budget Tracker

Create a simple tracking document to monitor word allocation:

```
Opening Hook: ___/75 words (target: 50-75)
DECONSTRUCT: ___/75 words (target: 60-75)
LEARN: ___/75 words (target: 60-75)
REMOVE: ___/75 words (target: 60-75)
PRACTICE: ___/75 words (target: 60-75)
Action Steps: ___/150 words (target: 100-150)
Closing: ___/50 words (target: 25-50)
---
TOTAL: ___/500 words (HARD LIMIT)
```

**Why**: Prevents overwriting; ensures balanced content across sections.

---

### Step 2: Draft Opening Hook (50-75 words)

**Goal**: Acknowledge overwhelm → reframe as achievable

**Template**:
```
[Acknowledge common fear about skill learning]
[Reframe: The real problem is misunderstanding time commitment]
[Promise: 20 hours of smart practice = basic competence]
```

**Example**:
> "Learning new skills feels impossible. You think you need years of practice, expensive courses, natural talent. But the problem isn't time—it's how you approach learning. Basic competence in any skill takes just 20 focused hours. Not mastery. Not expert-level. But functional enough to enjoy the skill and keep improving. Here's how."

**Checkpoint**:
- [ ] Acknowledges reader's overwhelm
- [ ] Reframes skill learning as achievable
- [ ] Mentions "20 hours" and "basic competence"
- [ ] 50-75 words

---

### Step 3: Draft DECONSTRUCT Section (60-75 words)

**Required Components**:
1. Bold name: **DECONSTRUCT the skill**
2. Recipe metaphor
3. Why (brain learns concrete, not abstract)
4. How (list parts → pick 3-5 critical)
5. Example (Spanish → 4 sub-skills)

**Template**:
```
**[NAME]**: [Brief definition]
[Metaphor sentence using recipe]
[Why this works: brain learns concrete actions, not abstractions]
[How to do it: 3 steps]
[Example: "Learn Spanish" broken into 4 concrete sub-skills]
```

**Example**:
> "**Deconstruct the skill.** Like a recipe—you don't cook 'dinner,' you prepare ingredients, sauté vegetables, season, plate. Your brain can't learn abstract concepts. It learns concrete actions. List everything the skill involves. Identify the smallest parts. Pick the most critical 3-5 sub-skills to start. Example: 'Learn Spanish' feels overwhelming—deconstruct into: Vocabulary (500 common words), Pronunciation (Spanish sounds), Grammar (present tense only), Conversation (speaking practice)."

**Checkpoint**:
- [ ] Bold name present
- [ ] Recipe metaphor included
- [ ] Why explained (concrete vs. abstract)
- [ ] How provided (3-step process)
- [ ] Spanish example with 4 sub-skills
- [ ] 60-75 words

---

### Step 4: Draft LEARN Section (60-75 words)

**Required Components**:
1. Bold name: **LEARN the minimum**
2. Directions metaphor
3. Why (endless learning delays practice)
4. How (3-5 resources, 2-3 hours, focus on self-correction)
5. Example (guitar: chords, tuning, not theory)

**Template**:
```
**[NAME]**: [Brief definition]
[Metaphor sentence using driving directions]
[Why this works: minimum learning enables practice faster]
[How to do it: 3 steps]
[Example: guitar—what to learn vs. what to skip]
```

**Example**:
> "**Learn the minimum.** Like driving directions—you don't need a map of the entire country. You need the route to your destination. Endless learning delays practice. You need enough to recognize 'this is right' vs 'this is wrong' while practicing. Find 3-5 high-quality resources. Spend 2-3 hours learning basics—not weeks. Focus on: 'How will I know if I'm doing this correctly?' For guitar, learn how chords should sound, finger placement, tuning. Skip music theory."

**Checkpoint**:
- [ ] Bold name present
- [ ] Directions metaphor included
- [ ] Why explained (prevents analysis paralysis)
- [ ] How provided (3 steps)
- [ ] Guitar example showing what to learn/skip
- [ ] 60-75 words

---

### Step 5: Draft REMOVE Section (60-75 words)

**Required Components**:
1. Bold name: **REMOVE the barriers**
2. Desk clearing metaphor
3. Why (friction kills practice)
4. How (list barriers → fix all → make easy)
5. Example (Spanish: partner, app, time, resources)

**Template**:
```
**[NAME]**: [Brief definition]
[Metaphor sentence using desk clearing]
[Why this works: friction kills consistency]
[How to do it: 3 steps]
[Example: Spanish—remove all barriers NOW before starting]
```

**Example**:
> "**Remove the barriers.** Like clearing your desk—clutter doesn't prevent work, but removing it makes starting effortless. Friction kills practice. If you have to 'find equipment' or 'set up' every time, you won't practice. List everything preventing you from practicing right now. Fix each barrier—buy equipment, find space, schedule time. Make practice as easy as possible. For Spanish: find language partner (now), download app (now), schedule 30-minute daily slot (now), bookmark resources (now)."

**Checkpoint**:
- [ ] Bold name present
- [ ] Desk clearing metaphor included
- [ ] Why explained (friction prevents consistency)
- [ ] How provided (3 steps)
- [ ] Spanish example with 4 barriers removed
- [ ] 60-75 words

---

### Step 6: Draft PRACTICE Section (60-75 words)

**Required Components**:
1. Bold name: **PRACTICE deliberately**
2. Weight lifting metaphor
3. Why (deliberate practice beats repetition)
4. How (20h commitment, attention, feedback, weaknesses)
5. Example (guitar: chord transitions, not easy songs)

**Template**:
```
**[NAME]**: [Brief definition]
[Metaphor sentence using weight lifting]
[Why this works: deliberate practice creates skills]
[How to do it: 4 steps]
[Example: guitar—what to practice (hard stuff) vs. avoid (easy stuff)]
```

**Example**:
> "**Practice deliberately.** Like lifting weights—random exercise doesn't build muscle. Progressive overload with proper form does. Deliberate practice with feedback builds skills. Commit to 20 hours. Track your time: 5/20, 10/20, 20/20. Practice with full attention—no TV, no distractions. Get immediate feedback: self-correct, ask others, record yourself, compare to experts. Focus on weaknesses, not what you're already good at. For guitar, practice chord transitions (boring but critical), not playing easy songs repeatedly."

**Checkpoint**:
- [ ] Bold name present
- [ ] Weight lifting metaphor included
- [ ] Why explained (deliberate vs. passive practice)
- [ ] How provided (4 steps including time tracking)
- [ ] Guitar example showing deliberate focus
- [ ] 60-75 words

---

### Step 7: Draft Action Steps (100-150 words)

**Goal**: Immediate implementation guide (completable within 1 hour)

**Required Structure**:
1. Right Now: Pick skill, deconstruct into parts, choose 3-5 critical sub-skills
2. This Week: Spend 2-3 hours learning minimum (self-correction focus)
3. Before Starting: Fix all barriers (equipment, space, time, resources)
4. Next 20 Hours: Track time, practice with attention, get feedback, focus on weaknesses

**Template**:
```
[Heading: "Your 20-Hour Skill Plan"]

1. **Right Now**: [Immediate deconstruction task]
2. **This Week**: [Minimum learning task with time limit]
3. **Before Starting**: [Barrier removal task with NOW emphasis]
4. **Next 20 Hours**: [Deliberate practice commitment with tracking]
```

**Example**:
> "**Your 20-Hour Skill Plan:**
>
> 1. **Right Now**: Pick your skill. List every part. Choose the critical 3-5 sub-skills to start. Ignore everything else for now.
>
> 2. **This Week**: Spend 2-3 hours learning the minimum—how to self-correct while practicing. Not weeks of theory. Just enough to know 'right' from 'wrong.'
>
> 3. **Before Starting**: Fix all practice barriers now. Buy equipment, find space, schedule time, download apps, find partners, bookmark resources. No excuses left.
>
> 4. **Next 20 Hours**: Track your time (5/20, 15/20, 20/20). Practice with full attention. Get immediate feedback. Focus on your weaknesses, not comfort zones. 20 focused hours = basic competence."

**Checkpoint**:
- [ ] 4 numbered steps present
- [ ] Step 1 addresses deconstruction (immediate)
- [ ] Step 2 addresses minimum learning (this week)
- [ ] Step 3 addresses barrier removal (before starting)
- [ ] Step 4 addresses deliberate practice (20h commitment)
- [ ] Implementable within 1 hour
- [ ] 100-150 words

### Step 8: Draft Closing (25-50 words)

**Goal**: Empower capability; reinforce achievability

**Template**:
```
[Reinforce: Basic competence is achievable]
[Empower: Reader has capability]
[Call to action: Start now]
```

**Example**:
> "Basic competence isn't years away—it's 20 smart hours. You can commit to 20 hours. That's where skills begin. Pick your skill. Start your 20 hours today."

**Checkpoint**:
- [ ] Reinforces achievability of basic competence
- [ ] Empowers reader's capability
- [ ] Positive, motivational tone
- [ ] 25-50 words

---

### Step 9: Validate Against Quality Gates

**Process**:
1. Open [contracts/rapid-mastery-schema.md](contracts/rapid-mastery-schema.md)
2. Check every box in Gate 1 (Constitutional Compliance)
3. Check every box in Gate 2 (Structural Requirements)
4. Check every box in Gate 3 (Functional Requirements)

**Critical Checks**:
- [ ] Total word count ≤500 words
- [ ] Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level 7-9 (use hemingwayapp.com)
- [ ] All 4 bold names present (DECONSTRUCT, LEARN, REMOVE, PRACTICE)
- [ ] All 4 metaphors present (recipe, directions, desk, weights)
- [ ] At least 2 concrete examples (Spanish + guitar minimum)
- [ ] No jargon (no "metacognition", "pedagogical", etc.)
- [ ] Positive tone throughout (no dwelling on failures)
- [ ] Action steps numbered and completable in 1 hour

**If any gate fails**: Revise and re-check before proceeding.

### Step 10: Final Polish

**Readability Pass**:
1. Read entire chapter aloud (catches awkward phrasing)
2. Check for repetitive words (vary vocabulary)
3. Ensure smooth transitions between sections
4. Verify all sentences are <25 words (easier reading)

**Tone Pass**:
1. Remove any negative language ("you failed", "you wasted time")
2. Replace passive voice with active voice
3. Ensure every section empowers action

**Accuracy Pass**:
1. Verify all examples are complete and accurate
2. Confirm time estimates are realistic (20h = 3-4 weeks at 30-45 min/day)
3. Check that competence vs. mastery distinction is clear

**Final Checkpoint**:
- [ ] Chapter reads naturally aloud
- [ ] Tone is positive and motivating throughout
- [ ] All facts and examples are accurate
- [ ] Word count ≤500 words
- [ ] Readability grade 7-9
- [ ] All 98 validation contract items passing

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Pitfall 1: Exceeding Word Limit
**Problem**: Easy to overwrite when explaining 4 steps
**Solution**: Use word budget tracker from Step 1; cut ruthlessly

### Pitfall 2: Abstract Language
**Problem**: Using phrases like "deconstruct your skill" without concrete example
**Solution**: Always pair abstract concept with concrete example (Spanish, guitar)

### Pitfall 3: Academic Jargon
**Problem**: Using terms like "metacognition", "pedagogical frameworks", "Bloom's taxonomy"
**Solution**: Use conversational vocabulary ("how your brain learns" vs. "cognitive processes")

### Pitfall 4: Missing Metaphors
**Problem**: Forgetting to include recipe/directions/desk/weights metaphors
**Solution**: Check Gate 2 validation contract—all 4 metaphors mandatory

### Pitfall 5: Vague Action Steps
**Problem**: Action steps like "practice a lot" or "learn the basics"
**Solution**: Use specific timeframes and concrete actions ("spend 2-3 hours this week")

### Pitfall 6: Negative Tone
**Problem**: Dwelling on past learning failures or wasted time
**Solution**: Acknowledge overwhelm briefly, then focus on solution and capability
