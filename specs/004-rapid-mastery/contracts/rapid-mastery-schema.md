## Gate 1: Constitutional Compliance (Must Pass All)

### Principle I: TONE - POSITIVE & MOTIVATIONAL

- [ ] No negative language about "wasted time" or "too old to learn"
- [ ] Framework presented as accessible to anyone willing to practice

### Principle II: STYLE - SIMPLE & CONCISE
- [ ] Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level 7-9 (8th-grade reading level)
- [ ] No learning jargon (no "metacognition", "pedagogical frameworks", "Bloom's taxonomy", "andragogy")

- [ ] Numbered action steps provided (1-4 clear instructions)
- [ ] Action steps completable within 1 hour
- [ ] No apps, courses, or specialized resources required (notebook sufficient)

- [ ] Each step has concrete "How" section (specific actions to take)
- [ ] Reader can create first 20-hour skill plan without external tools

### Principle IV: LENGTH - FOCUSED
- [ ] Total word count ≤500 words (strict limit)

## Gate 2: Structural Requirements (Must Pass All)

### 4-Part Structure (FR-009)
- [ ] **Opening Hook** present (50-75 words, acknowledges overwhelm → reframes as achievable)
- [ ] **Core Teaching** present (250-300 words, all 4 steps with metaphors and examples)
- [ ] **Action Steps** present (100-150 words, numbered, implementable within 1 hour)
- [ ] **Closing** present (25-50 words, empowering capability message)

### Step 1: DECONSTRUCT the Skill
- [ ] Bold name "DECONSTRUCT the skill" present
- [ ] Recipe metaphor included (cooking dinner = prepare ingredients, not doing everything at once)
- [ ] Why explained (brain learns concrete actions, not abstract concepts)
- [ ] How provided (list parts → pick 3-5 critical sub-skills)
- [ ] Example given (Spanish → vocabulary + pronunciation + grammar + conversation)

### Step 2: LEARN the Minimum
- [ ] Bold name "LEARN the minimum" present
- [ ] Directions metaphor included (need route to destination, not map of entire country)
- [ ] Why explained (endless learning delays practice; need enough to self-correct)
- [ ] How provided (3-5 resources, 2-3 hours, focus on "How will I know if I'm doing this correctly?")
- [ ] Example given (guitar: how chords sound, finger placement, tuning—not music theory)

### Step 3: REMOVE the Barriers
- [ ] Bold name "REMOVE the barriers" present
- [ ] Desk clearing metaphor included (clutter doesn't prevent work, but removing makes starting effortless)
- [ ] Why explained (friction kills practice; removing barriers upfront makes practice easy)
- [ ] How provided (list barriers → fix each → make practice effortless)
- [ ] Example given (Spanish: find partner now, download app now, schedule time now, bookmark resources now)

### Step 4: PRACTICE Deliberately
- [ ] Bold name "PRACTICE deliberately" present
- [ ] Weight lifting metaphor included (progressive overload with form builds muscle, not random exercise)
- [ ] Why explained (deliberate practice with feedback beats passive repetition)
- [ ] How provided (commit to 20h, full attention, immediate feedback, focus on weaknesses)
- [ ] Example given (guitar: chord transitions timed/recorded/compared, not easy songs repeated)

## Gate 3: Functional Requirements (Must Pass All)

### Core Content (FR-001 to FR-004)
- [ ] **FR-001**: Complete 20-Hour Rule technique with all 4 steps clearly explained
- [ ] **FR-002**: Simple rationale for why 20 hours is sufficient for basic competence (at 8th-grade level)
- [ ] **FR-003**: Clear distinction between "basic competence" (20h = functional) and "mastery" (years)
- [ ] **FR-004**: 2+ concrete examples showing skill deconstruction (minimum: Spanish + 1 other)

### Action & Language (FR-005 to FR-008)
- [ ] **FR-005**: Numbered action steps implementable within 1 hour
- [ ] **FR-006**: Positive, motivational language throughout (no dwelling on failures)
- [ ] **FR-007**: Simple vocabulary appropriate for 8th-grade level
- [ ] **FR-008**: Scannable format (headings, bold, short paragraphs, examples)

### Structure & Length (FR-009 to FR-011)
- [ ] **FR-009**: 4-part structure present (Hook → Core → Actions → Closing)
- [ ] **FR-010**: Total word count ≤500 words
- [ ] **FR-011**: Empowering closing reinforcing capability to learn new skills

### Accessibility (FR-012 to FR-013)
- [ ] **FR-012**: No learning jargon (no academic terminology, no field-specific language)
- [ ] **FR-013**: Tool-free implementation (notebook and practice time sufficient)

## Edge Case Handling

### Edge Case 1: Skill More/Less Complex Than 20 Hours
- [ ] Brief mention acknowledging skill variability (simpler skills ~10h, complex skills require simpler version)
- [ ] Clear messaging: 20 hours is average for basic competence, not universal rule

### Edge Case 2: "I Completed 20 Hours But I'm Not Competent"
- [ ] Action steps emphasize deliberate practice (focused attention + feedback + weaknesses)
- [ ] Distinction between passive repetition and deliberate practice explained

### Edge Case 3: Limited Time (30 min/day)
- [ ] Optional: Brief acknowledgment that 20 hours at 30 min/day = 3-4 weeks
- [ ] Framing: Timeline adjusts, commitment remains; alternative is never starting

### Edge Case 4: Need Equipment/Teacher/Resources
- [ ] Step 3 (REMOVE barriers) explicitly addresses resource barriers
- [ ] Examples show free/cheap solutions (apps, borrowed equipment, online partners)
