## Notes

**Specification Complete**: All requirements clearly defined for Chapter 3: The Blueprint of Breakthrough teaching the "100-Hour Focus" technique. The spec follows the same successful pattern as Chapters 1 and 2, adapted for goal-planning and breakthrough achievement. All 13 functional requirements are testable, all 9 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic, and the 3 user stories provide independent test criteria. Ready to proceed to planning phase.
