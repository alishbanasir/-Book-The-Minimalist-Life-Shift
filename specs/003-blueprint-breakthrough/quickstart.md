## 10-Step Implementation Process

### Step 1: Review Design Artifacts (15 min)
**Read in this order:**
1. [spec.md](spec.md) - Functional requirements and success criteria
2. [data-model.md](data-model.md) - Framework structure and components
3. [research.md](research.md) - 100-hour rationale and examples
4. [contracts/blueprint-breakthrough-schema.md](contracts/blueprint-breakthrough-schema.md) - Validation gates

**Outcome**: Clear understanding of BREAK-BEGIN-BUILD framework, word budget allocation, and quality requirements

---

### Step 2: Set Up Writing Environment (5 min)
**Tools needed:**
- Text editor with word count (VS Code, Google Docs, or Hemingway Editor)
- Readability checker (Hemingway Editor or readable.com)
- Timer (for tracking sections)

**Create document structure:**
```markdown

```

### Step 3: Write Opening Hook (20 min)
**Target**: 50-75 words

**Structure** (from data-model.md):
- Acknowledge overwhelm: "Your goal feels impossibly large"
- Reframe: "But every breakthrough started with 100 focused hours"
- Create connection: Shared experience of goal paralysis
- Transition: "Here's how to break it down"

**Example opening:**
> "That big goal you've been putting off—writing a book, launching a business, mastering a new skill—feels impossible, doesn't it? Not because you lack ability, but because you're trying to see the entire path at once. Here's the truth: Every breakthrough you've ever admired started with just 100 focused hours. Let me show you how to break yours down."

**Test**: Does it immediately capture overwhelmed reader? Does reframe feel hopeful (not preachy)?

---

### Step 4: Write BREAK Section (25 min)
**Target**: 75-90 words

**Must include** (from data-model.md):
- **Bold name**: **BREAK Your Goal**
- **Metaphor**: Construction blueprint (house → foundation, framing, wiring, finishing)
- **Why**: "Your brain can plan 100 hours. It can't plan 1000 hours."
- **How**: 3 steps (estimate total → divide by 100 → name blocks)
- **Example**: "Write a book" (400h) → 4 blocks (Research 100h, Draft Part 1 100h, Draft Part 2 100h, Revise 100h)

**Template structure:**
```
**BREAK Your Goal.** Think of it like a construction blueprint—[metaphor explanation].
Why does this work? [Simple rationale in one sentence].
Here's how: [3-step process].
For example, [concrete goal breakdown with hours].
```

---

### Step 5: Write BEGIN Section (25 min)
**Target**: 75-90 words

**Must include**:
- **Bold name**: **BEGIN with Block One**
- **Metaphor**: Road trip (first 100 miles, not final destination)
- **Why**: "Committing to 100 hours feels possible. Committing to 400 hours feels overwhelming."
- **How**: Pick Block 1, commit to just 100 hours (ignore rest), start tracking progress
- **Example**: Not "writing 400-hour book" → just "doing 100 hours of research"

**Key insight**: "BEGIN doesn't mean 'start the entire goal'—it means 'start Block 1.'"

---

### Step 6: Write BUILD Section (25 min)
**Target**: 75-90 words

**Must include**:
- **Bold name**: **BUILD Through Momentum**
- **Metaphor**: Climbing stairs (one floor at a time, not jumping to top)
- **Why**: "Completed blocks build confidence and skills for next block"
- **How**: Focus only on current block (0 → 100h), celebrate at 100h, start Block 2 when ready
- **Example**: Block 1 complete → start Block 2 (one at a time builds entire goal)

**Key insight**: "You BUILD breakthroughs block by block. No one builds in one massive push."

---

### Step 7: Write Action Steps (30 min)
**Target**: 100-150 words

**Numbered structure** (from data-model.md):
1. **Right Now** (immediate): Take your goal, estimate total hours, divide by 100, name your 3-5 blocks
2. **This Week** (commitment): Commit to Block 1 only (ignore the rest), start tracking hours (1/100, 10/100, etc.)
3. **First 100 Hours** (execution): Focus only on completing Block 1, track progress regularly
4. **After Block 1** (reflection): Celebrate completion, reflect on learning, decide if you want Block 2

**Key language**:
- Use "Right Now" not "Step 1" (more immediate)
- Emphasize tracking (10/100, 50/100, 100/100)
- Acknowledge breaks between blocks are okay

---

### Step 8: Write Closing (15 min)
**Target**: 25-50 words

**Must reinforce** (from data-model.md):
- Key message: "Breakthroughs aren't magic—they're 100 focused hours at a time"
- Tone: Confident, capable, systematic (not heroic or lucky)
- Empowerment: Reader has ability to achieve breakthroughs

**Example closing:**
> "Breakthroughs aren't born from luck, inspiration, or superhuman effort. They're built through systematic focus—100 hours at a time. You can commit to 100 hours. That's where transformation begins."

---

### Step 9: Validation Check (30 min)
**Use validation contract:** [contracts/blueprint-breakthrough-schema.md](contracts/blueprint-breakthrough-schema.md)

**Run through all 3 gates:**
1. **Gate 1 (Constitutional)**: Check tone (positive?), style (8th-grade?), actionability (tool-free?), length (≤500w?)
2. **Gate 2 (Structural)**: Verify each section (Hook, B-B-B, Actions, Closing) has required components
3. **Gate 3 (Functional)**: Confirm all FR-001 to FR-013 satisfied

**Quick Pre-Flight Check** (5 critical items):
- [ ] Word count ≤500 words
- [ ] Flesch-Kincaid grade 7-9
- [ ] BREAK-BEGIN-BUILD complete (name, metaphor, why, how, example each)
- [ ] 2+ concrete examples (book + business/skill/fitness)
- [ ] No jargon (search: sprint, milestone, Gantt, OKR, KPI)

**Tools:**
- Word count: Most text editors have built-in counters
- Readability: Hemingway Editor (hemingwayapp.com) or Readable.com
- Jargon check: Ctrl+F search for banned terms

---

### Step 10: Refinement (30 min)
**Focus areas:**

1. **Word Budget Compliance**:
   - Hook: 50-75 words ✓
   - BREAK: 75-90 words ✓
   - BEGIN: 75-90 words ✓
   - BUILD: 75-90 words ✓
   - Action Steps: 100-150 words ✓
   - Closing: 25-50 words ✓
   - **Total: 400-500 words** (buffer: 0-100 words)

2. **Simplify Language**:
   - Replace complex words with simple alternatives (use Hemingway Editor suggestions)
   - Break long sentences (aim for 15-20 words per sentence)
   - Remove unnecessary adjectives/adverbs

3. **Strengthen Examples**:
   - Ensure examples are specific (not "some hours" → "100 hours")
   - Use diverse goals (book, business, skill—not all creative goals)
   - Show clear block structure (Block 1: X, Block 2: Y, Block 3: Z)

4. **Polish Metaphors**:
   - Construction blueprint (BREAK): Clear visual of plans breaking house into phases
   - Road trip (BEGIN): First 100 miles, not worrying about final destination
   - Climbing stairs (BUILD): One floor at a time, not jumping to top

## Mandatory Components Checklist

**From research.md and data-model.md:**

- [ ] Alliterative naming (B-B-B pattern)
- [ ] Construction blueprint metaphor (BREAK)
- [ ] Road trip metaphor (BEGIN)
- [ ] Climbing stairs metaphor (BUILD)
- [ ] Paralysis reduction language ("just 100 hours, not the whole goal")
- [ ] At least 2 goal breakdown examples (book + 1 more)
- [ ] Simple division math (total hours ÷ 100 = number of blocks)
- [ ] Time translation table or explanation (100h = 2-3 months at 1-2h/day)
- [ ] Focused work distinction (what counts vs. what doesn't)
- [ ] Tracking guidance (10/100, 50/100, 100/100 progress)

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Complexity Creep**: Adding too much detail about time tracking, apps, or optimization → Keep it simple (pen and paper)
2. **Jargon Slip**: Using planning terms unconsciously → Search for banned terms before finalizing
3. **Word Budget Overflow**: Over-explaining concepts → Trust reader intelligence; be concise
4. **Missing Examples**: Vague "you could do X" → Always use concrete hours and block names
5. **Negative Tone**: Dwelling on past failures or overwhelm → Acknowledge briefly, reframe quickly
6. **Unclear Metaphors**: Abstract comparisons → Use concrete visuals (blueprint plans, road maps, staircases)
7. **Action Steps Too Vague**: "Plan your goal" → "Estimate total hours, divide by 100, name each block"

---

## Next Steps After Completion

1. Save draft to `content/chapters/chapter-3-blueprint-breakthrough.md`
2. Run user testing with 5-10 beta readers (validate SC-001 to SC-009)
3. Collect feedback on clarity, motivation, and actionability
4. Refine based on feedback (stay within 500-word limit)
5. Final validation check before publishing
6. Create PHR documenting implementation process
