# Data Model: Chapter 3 - The Blueprint of Breakthrough

**Feature**: 003-blueprint-breakthrough
**Date**: 2025-12-03
**Purpose**: Define the structure, components, and relationships of the "100-Hour Focus" framework

---

## Core Entities

### 1. 100-Hour Focus Technique

**Definition**: A goal-planning system that breaks large, overwhelming goals into manageable 100-hour blocks of focused work; makes breakthroughs achievable through systematic time investment rather than heroic leaps.

**Core Philosophy**:
- **Breakthrough = Systematic Building**: Not magical inspiration or perfect conditions
- **100 Hours = Sweet Spot**: Neither too small (trivial) nor too large (impossible)
- **One Block at a Time**: Focus on Block 1, not the entire mountain

**Framework Components**:
1. Goal Analysis System (Step 1: BREAK)
2. Starting Point Selection (Step 2: BEGIN)
3. Momentum Building Process (Step 3: BUILD)

---

## Framework Structure

### Step 1: BREAK Your Goal

**Purpose**: Divide overwhelming goal into concrete, manageable 100-hour blocks

**Components**:
- **Name**: BREAK your goal
- **Metaphor**: Like a construction blueprint—breaking a house into foundation, framing, wiring, finishing (not building everything at once)
- **Why (Simple Rationale)**: Your brain can plan 100 hours. It can't plan 1000 hours. Breaking goals into blocks makes the impossible feel doable.
- **How (Action)**:
  1. Estimate total hours needed for your goal (rough guess: 200h, 500h, 1000h)
  2. Divide by 100 to get number of blocks (200h ÷ 100 = 2 blocks)
  3. Name each block with what you'll accomplish (Block 1: Research & Outline, Block 2: Draft & Revise)
- **Example**: "Write a book" feels impossible → BREAK into 4 blocks (Research 100h, Draft Part 1 100h, Draft Part 2 100h, Revise 100h) → Now you have a roadmap

**Key Insight**: You don't need the perfect breakdown—just a starting structure. You'll refine as you go.

### Step 2: BEGIN with Block One

**Purpose**: Overcome paralysis by committing to just the first 100 hours (not the entire goal)

**Components**:
- **Name**: BEGIN with Block One
- **Metaphor**: Like starting a road trip—you don't need to see the final destination, just the next 100 miles
- **Why (Simple Rationale)**: Committing to everything feels overwhelming. Committing to 100 hours feels possible. After Block 1, you can decide if you want Block 2.
- **How (Action)**:
  1. Look at your blocks from BREAK step
  2. Pick Block 1 (usually the foundation or learning block)
  3. Commit to just those 100 hours—ignore the rest for now
  4. Start tracking: "I'm 10/100 hours into Block 1"
- **Example**: Instead of "I'm writing a 400-hour book" (scary) → "I'm doing 100 hours of research" (manageable). After 100 hours, you'll know if you want to continue.

**Key Insight**: BEGIN doesn't mean "start the entire goal"—it means "start Block 1." Massive difference.

---

### Step 3: BUILD Through Momentum

**Purpose**: Complete blocks one by one, building momentum and progress

**Components**:
- **Name**: BUILD through momentum
- **Metaphor**: Like climbing stairs—each block is one floor. You don't jump to the top; you climb floor by floor.
- **Why (Simple Rationale)**: Every completed block gives you confidence and skills for the next block. Momentum builds naturally—Block 2 feels easier than Block 1 because you've learned.
- **How (Action)**:
  1. Focus only on completing current block (Block 1: 0 → 100 hours)
  2. When you hit 100 hours, celebrate completion
  3. Reflect: "What did I learn? What's next?"
  4. Start Block 2 only when ready (you can take breaks between blocks)
- **Example**: After Block 1 (Research 100h) complete, you're not starting "the book"—you're starting Block 2 (Draft 100h). One block at a time builds the entire book.

**Key Insight**: You BUILD breakthroughs block by block. No one builds in one massive push.

## 100-Hour Block Structure

**Definition**: A unit of focused work (not calendar time) representing real, concentrated effort toward a specific sub-goal.

**Time Translation**:
| Intensity | Hours/Day | Calendar Time | Best For |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|----------|
| Consistent | 1-2 hours/day | 2-3 months | Full-time workers, parents |
| Intensive | 3-4 hours/day | 3-4 weeks | Students, sabbaticals |
| Weekend Warrior | 5-8 hours/weekend | 3-4 months | Busy schedules, side projects |

**What Counts as "Focused Work"** (see research.md for full detail):
- ✅ Active practice (writing, coding, building, training)
- ✅ Deliberate learning (notes, summaries, teaching)
- ✅ Creation (drafting, designing, publishing)
- ✅ Problem-solving (debugging, revising, testing)
- ❌ Passive consumption (watching videos, reading without applying)
- ❌ Endless planning (researching forever without executing)

**Simple Test**: "If someone asks 'what did you create or learn in that hour?', can you give a concrete answer?"

## Content Structure Map (500 Words Total)

### Opening Hook (50-75 words)
**Purpose**: Create connection with overwhelmed reader
**Key Message**: Your goal feels impossible because you're seeing the whole thing; break it into blocks
**Tone**: Acknowledging overwhelm → reframing as systematic building

### Core Teaching (250-300 words)
**Purpose**: Teach BREAK-BEGIN-BUILD framework

**Section 1: BREAK Your Goal (75-90 words)**
- Bold name + metaphor (construction blueprint)
- Why (brain can plan 100h, not 1000h)
- How (estimate total → divide by 100 → name blocks)
- Example (write book → 4 blocks)

**Section 2: BEGIN with Block One (75-90 words)**
- Bold name + metaphor (road trip - first 100 miles)
- Why (committing to 100h feels possible vs. entire goal)
- How (pick Block 1, commit to just 100h, start tracking)
- Example (not "writing 400h book", just "doing 100h research")

**Section 3: BUILD Through Momentum (75-90 words)**
- Bold name + metaphor (climbing stairs - one floor at a time)
- Why (completed blocks build confidence and skills)
- How (focus on current block, celebrate at 100h, start next when ready)
- Example (Block 1 complete → start Block 2, one at a time builds whole)

### Action Steps (100-150 words)
**Purpose**: Immediate implementation guide

1. **Right Now**: Take your goal, estimate total hours, divide by 100, name your 3-5 blocks
2. **This Week**: Commit to Block 1 only (ignore the rest), start tracking hours
3. **First 100 Hours**: Focus only on completing Block 1, track progress (10/100, 50/100, 100/100)
4. **After Block 1**: Celebrate, reflect on what you learned, decide if you want Block 2

### Closing Motivation (25-50 words)
**Purpose**: Empower capability
**Key Message**: Breakthroughs aren't magic—they're 100 focused hours at a time
**Tone**: Confident, capable, systematic (not heroic or lucky)

## Edge Cases & Boundaries

### Edge Case 1: Goal Smaller Than 100 Hours
**Scenario**: Skill only needs 30-50 hours
**Solution**: Group related skills into one 100-hour block
**Content Note**: Brief mention in action steps ("If your goal is smaller, combine related skills into one block")

### Edge Case 2: Massive Goals (10,000+ hours)
**Scenario**: Goal like "become a doctor" requires years
**Solution**: Break into major phases, each with multiple blocks
**Content Note**: Acknowledge in core teaching ("Even massive goals are just many 100-hour blocks stacked together")

### Edge Case 3: Limited Time (2-3 hours/week)
**Scenario**: Block will take ~1 year to complete
**Solution**: Reframe timeline but keep structure
**Content Note**: Mention in time translation ("At 2h/week, Block 1 takes ~1 year—that's okay, the alternative is never starting")

### Edge Case 4: Block Completed, Outcome Not Achieved
**Scenario**: Spent 100 hours but didn't master skill/complete sub-goal
**Solution**: Blocks are learning units, use insights for next block
**Content Note**: Closing addresses ("Every block teaches you—use what you learned for Block 2")
