# Validation Contract: Chapter 3 - The Blueprint of Breakthrough

**Feature**: 003-blueprint-breakthrough
**Date**: 2025-12-03
**Purpose**: Define quality gates and validation criteria for Chapter 3 content creation

---

## Gate 1: Constitutional Compliance

**Purpose**: Verify adherence to project Constitution's 4 principles

### Principle I: TONE - POSITIVE & MOTIVATIONAL
- [ ] Language focuses on breakthrough achievement (empowering action, not dwelling on failures)
- [ ] Framework reframes large goals as achievable through systematic 100-hour blocks
- [ ] No negative language about past goal failures or procrastination
- [ ] Closing reinforces reader's capability to achieve breakthroughs

**Test**: Read chapter. Does it feel empowering and forward-focused (not discouraging or dwelling on problems)?

### Principle II: STYLE - SIMPLE & CONCISE
- [ ] 8th-grade reading level achieved (Flesch-Kincaid grade 7-9)
- [ ] No planning jargon (no "sprints", "milestones", "Gantt charts", "OKRs", "KPIs")
- [ ] Conversational vocabulary throughout
- [ ] Scannable format: clear headings, short paragraphs (3-4 sentences max), bullet points where helpful

**Test**: Run readability checker (Hemingway Editor or readable.com). Grade level 7-9? Any jargon highlighted?

### Principle III: KNOWLEDGE - ACTIONABLE
- [ ] Technique implementable within 1 hour with pen and paper (no apps/software required)
- [ ] Numbered action steps provided (Right Now, This Week, First 100 Hours, After Block 1)
- [ ] 2+ concrete examples showing goal breakdown process
- [ ] Clear distinction between "focused work" and "thinking about goals"

**Test**: Can a reader take this chapter and create their first 100-hour block plan on paper in 1 hour?

### Principle IV: LENGTH - FOCUSED
- [ ] Total word count ≤500 words
- [ ] 4-part structure maintained (Hook → Core Teaching → Action Steps → Closing)
- [ ] Every sentence adds value (no filler, no unnecessary elaboration)

**Test**: Word count tool confirms ≤500 words? Each section serves clear purpose?

---

## Gate 2: Structural Requirements

**Purpose**: Verify chapter follows proven content structure from Chapters 1 & 2

### Hook (50-75 words)
- [ ] Opens with acknowledgment of reader's overwhelm about large goals
- [ ] Creates connection through shared experience
- [ ] Reframes problem: "Your goal feels impossible because you're seeing the whole thing; break it into blocks"
- [ ] Transition to framework

**Test**: Does opening immediately capture overwhelmed reader? Does reframe feel hopeful?

### Core Teaching (250-300 words)
- [ ] **Step 1 (BREAK)**: Bold name, construction blueprint metaphor, why (brain can plan 100h not 1000h), how (estimate → divide → name), example
- [ ] **Step 2 (BEGIN)**: Bold name, road trip metaphor, why (100h feels possible), how (pick Block 1, commit, track), example
- [ ] **Step 3 (BUILD)**: Bold name, climbing stairs metaphor, why (momentum builds), how (focus current block, celebrate, start next), example
- [ ] Each step follows consistent structure: name + metaphor + why + how + example

**Test**: Can reader recall B-B-B pattern after reading once? Does each step feel concrete and actionable?

### Action Steps (100-150 words)
- [ ] Numbered steps (1-4) with clear timeframes
- [ ] Right Now: Estimate total hours, divide by 100, name blocks
- [ ] This Week: Commit to Block 1 only, start tracking
- [ ] First 100 Hours: Focus on completing Block 1, track progress
- [ ] After Block 1: Celebrate, reflect, decide on Block 2

**Test**: Are steps immediately implementable? Does each step build on previous?

### Closing (25-50 words)
- [ ] Reinforces key message: "Breakthroughs aren't magic—they're 100 focused hours at a time"
- [ ] Empowering capability tone (not heroic or lucky)
- [ ] Confident, systematic framing

**Test**: Does closing leave reader feeling capable and ready to start?

## Gate 3: Functional Requirements (from spec.md)

**Purpose**: Verify all 13 functional requirements satisfied

### Core Technique Requirements
- [ ] **FR-001**: Complete 100-Hour Focus technique explained with clear goal-to-blocks process
- [ ] **FR-002**: Simple rationale for why 100 hours is optimal (not 10h or 1000h) at 8th-grade level
- [ ] **FR-003**: Clear distinction between "thinking about goals" (doesn't count) and "focused work toward goals" (counts)

### Examples & Application
- [ ] **FR-004**: 2+ concrete examples (must include "write a book"; second example from: business, skill, fitness)
- [ ] **FR-005**: Numbered action steps implementable within 1 hour

### Language & Tone
- [ ] **FR-006**: Positive, motivational language throughout (no dwelling on past failures)
- [ ] **FR-007**: Simple, conversational vocabulary suitable for 8th-grade reading level
- [ ] **FR-008**: Scannable format with clear headings, short paragraphs, bold names

### Structure & Format
- [ ] **FR-009**: 4-part structure (Hook → Core Teaching → Action Steps → Closing)
- [ ] **FR-010**: ≤500 words total
- [ ] **FR-011**: Empowering closing reinforcing reader's capability

### Simplicity Requirements
- [ ] **FR-012**: No planning jargon (no "sprints", "milestones", "Gantt charts", "OKRs", "KPIs", "dependencies")
- [ ] **FR-013**: Tool-free technique (pen and paper sufficient; no apps, spreadsheets, or specialized software)

## Validation Checklist Summary

**Total Gates**: 3
**Total Criteria**: 38 checkboxes

### Quick Pre-Flight Check
Before submitting Chapter 3 content, verify these 5 critical items:

1. ✅ Word count ≤500 words
2. ✅ Flesch-Kincaid grade 7-9 (8th-grade level)
3. ✅ BREAK-BEGIN-BUILD framework complete with all components (name, metaphor, why, how, example for each)
4. ✅ 2+ concrete goal breakdown examples (book + 1 other)
5. ✅ No jargon (search document for: sprint, milestone, Gantt, OKR, KPI)

### Success Criteria Mapping (from spec.md)
