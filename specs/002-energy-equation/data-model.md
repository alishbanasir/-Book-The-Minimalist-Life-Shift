# Data Model: Chapter 2 - The Energy Equation

**Feature**: 002-energy-equation
**Date**: 2025-12-03
**Purpose**: Define the structure, components, and relationships of the "Recharge, Not Resign" framework

---

## Core Entities

### 1. Recharge, Not Resign Framework

**Definition**: A 3-rule system for preventing burnout and maintaining focus through strategic energy management that distinguishes productive rest from avoidance.

**Core Distinction**:
- **Recharge**: Strategic, time-bound, intentional energy restoration that re-enables action
- **Resign**: Passive, indefinite avoidance or giving up without plan to return

**Framework Components**:
1. Recognition System (Step 1: RECOGNIZE)
2. Restoration Techniques (Step 2: RESTORE)
3. Re-Engagement Process (Step 3: RETURN)

## Framework Structure

### Rule 1: RECOGNIZE the Drain

**Purpose**: Build awareness of energy depletion signals before reaching burnout

**Components**:
- **Name**: RECOGNIZE the drain
- **Metaphor**: Like a phone battery icon turning red—warning before complete shutdown
- **Why (Simple Neuroscience)**: Your brain sends fatigue signals (difficulty focusing, irritability, physical tension) when mental energy depletes. Catching these early prevents full burnout.
- **How (Action)**: Pause when you notice: can't focus on one task, re-reading same sentence, feeling frustrated by small things, or physical tension (shoulders, jaw)
- **Example**: Notice yourself re-reading email 3 times without comprehending → RECOGNIZE signal: "My mental battery is low"

**Key Insight**: Recognition is ACTIVE observation, not judgment ("I'm failing" → just data: "Energy is low")

### Rule 2: RESTORE the Tank

**Purpose**: Apply science-based, equipment-free techniques to rapidly restore energy

**Components**:
- **Name**: RESTORE the tank
- **Metaphor**: Like plugging in your phone—deliberate action to refuel
- **Why (Simple Neuroscience)**: Your brain needs glucose and oxygen to function. Strategic rest (breathing, movement, task-switching) delivers fresh oxygen, reduces stress hormones, and lets fatigued brain networks recover.
- **How (Action)**: Choose ONE technique and set a time limit (5-15 minutes):
  - **Breathing Reset**: 3 physiological sighs (double inhale, long exhale)
  - **Movement Recharge**: 10-minute walk, stretch, or physical task
  - **Task Switch**: Change from mental to physical work, or focused to creative
- **Example**: After recognizing low energy → step outside for 10-minute walk → return with clearer thinking

**Key Insight**: Restoration is TIME-BOUND (5-15 minutes planned) and ACTIVE (you choose the technique), not passive escape

**Technique Details** (for reference, not all in chapter):

| Technique | Time | Why It Works (Simple) | When to Use |
|-----------|------|----------------------|-------------|
| Physiological Sigh | 30 seconds | Tells body "danger over, rest now" | Stress, anxiety, overwhelm |
| Walk/Movement | 10-15 min | Fresh oxygen to brain, resets thinking | Mental fatigue, stuck thinking |
| Task Switching | 10-20 min | Rests tired brain networks | Can't focus, creativity block |

---

### Rule 3: RETURN to Action

**Purpose**: Re-engage with work from restored state, proving recharge is productive (not procrastination)

**Components**:
- **Name**: RETURN to action
- **Metaphor**: Like starting your car after refueling—you go further than before
- **Why (Simple Neuroscience)**: Restored energy = better decisions, clearer thinking, faster work. You accomplish MORE by recharging than by pushing through exhaustion.
- **How (Action)**: After timed recharge, pick ONE clear next step (not everything, just one thing). Example: "I'll draft the opening paragraph" or "I'll respond to 3 emails"
- **Example**: After 10-minute walk → return to desk → complete task in 30 minutes that was taking 2 hours before

**Key Insight**: RETURN proves recharge works—you measure success by what you accomplish AFTER rest, not during

## Recharge vs Resign: The Critical Distinction

### Recharge Characteristics (Strategic Rest)
- **Time-Bound**: Has clear start and end (5 min, 15 min, 90 min max)
- **Intentional**: You choose when and how long
- **Active**: Deliberate technique (breathing, walking, switching)
- **Purposeful**: Goal is energy restoration to return to task
- **Outcome**: Renewed energy, clearer thinking, continued progress

### Resign Characteristics (Avoidance)
- **Time-Unbounded**: No clear end time ("I'll do it later")
- **Passive**: Happens to you, not chosen deliberately
- **Reactive**: Escape from difficulty without plan
- **Aimless**: No restoration goal, just avoidance
- **Outcome**: Guilt, anxiety, continued depletion, no progress

### Comparison Table

| Aspect | Recharge (Strategic) | Resign (Avoidance) |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Duration | 5-90 minutes, planned | Hours/days, unplanned |
| Intent | "I'll recharge for 10 minutes, then continue" | "I can't do this, I give up" |
| Activity | Breathing, walking, switching tasks | Endless scrolling, binge-watching, procrastinating |
| Energy State After | Restored, clearer thinking | Still depleted, added guilt |
| Progress | Task completed with better quality | Task avoided, deadline missed |
| Feeling | Empowered, capable | Guilty, anxious, defeated |

## Content Structure Map (500 Words Total)

### Opening Hook (50-75 words)
**Purpose**: Create emotional connection, introduce energy crisis
**Key Message**: You've been taught pushing through exhaustion is strength; actually it's burnout
**Tone**: Acknowledging struggle → reframing rest as power move

### Core Teaching (250-300 words)
**Purpose**: Teach 3-rule framework with simple science

**Section 1: RECOGNIZE (75-90 words)**
- Bold name + metaphor
- Why (simple neuroscience)
- How (actionable steps)
- Example (1 sentence)

**Section 2: RESTORE (75-90 words)**
- Bold name + metaphor
- Why (simple neuroscience)
- How (3 technique options)
- Example (1 sentence)

**Section 3: RETURN (75-90 words)**
- Bold name + metaphor
- Why (simple neuroscience)
- How (pick one next step)
- Example (1 sentence)

## Edge Cases & Boundaries

### Edge Case 1: "I Can't Take a Break" Situations
**Scenario**: In meeting, childcare, urgent deadline
**Solution**: Micro-recharges (3 deep breaths, shoulder rolls, 30-second window gaze)
**Content Note**: Mention in Action Steps as adaptation

### Edge Case 2: Chronic vs Temporary Fatigue
**Scenario**: Reader has chronic fatigue syndrome (medical condition)
**Solution**: Scope boundary in opening hook ("If exhausted by end of day but fine after rest, this is for you")
**Content Note**: One sentence acknowledging medical fatigue needs doctor, not self-help

### Edge Case 3: Misinterpreting Recharge as Avoidance
**Scenario**: Reader uses "recharge" to justify endless procrastination
**Solution**: Emphasize time-bound nature (5-15 min) and RETURN step (proving effectiveness)
**Content Note**: Recharge vs Resign distinction section addresses explicitly
