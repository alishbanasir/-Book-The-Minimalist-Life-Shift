## Step 1: Review Word Budget (5 minutes)

**Target Structure** (from data-model.md):

| Section | Target Words | Purpose |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Opening Hook | 50-75 words | Emotional connection, introduce energy crisis |
| RECOGNIZE section | 75-90 words | Name, metaphor, why, how, example |
| RESTORE section | 75-90 words | Name, metaphor, why, 3 techniques, example |
| RETURN section | 75-90 words | Name, metaphor, why, how, example |
| Recharge vs Resign | 20-25 words | Quick distinction |
| Action Steps | 100-150 words | 3-4 numbered, specific actions |
| Closing Motivation | 25-50 words | Empowering statement |
| **TOTAL** | **445-500 words** | Maximum 500 words |

**Budget Notes**:
- Don't exceed maximums (hard limit: 500 total)
- You have 5-55 word buffer for adjustments
- Prioritize RESTORE section if needing extra words (most actionable content)

---

## Step 2: Draft Opening Hook (15 minutes)

**Goal**: Create emotional connection in 50-75 words

**Template** (from research.md Acknowledge + Reframe + Empower):
1. **Acknowledge**: Recognize reader's exhaustion/pressure to push through
2. **Reframe**: Introduce "recharge" as strategic strength (not weakness)
3. **Engage**: Promise simple framework

**Writing Tips**:
- Start with relatable scenario ("Your brain is foggy by 2pm...")
- Use "you" language (direct address)
- Create hope without dwelling on burnout symptoms
- End with forward momentum ("Here's how to refuel fast...")

**Example Framework**:
```
[Acknowledge struggle in 1-2 sentences] You've been taught that pushing through exhaustion shows strength. But your brain has a battery—and ignoring the low-power warning leads to burnout. [Reframe + Promise] What if recharging wasn't weak, but smart? [Engage] Here's how to restore your energy in minutes, not hours.
```

**Validation**:
- [ ] Word count: 50-75 words
- [ ] Positive tone (hope, not doom)
- [ ] Relatable scenario mentioned
- [ ] Promise of solution clear

**Action**: Draft hook, check word count, move to Step 3

---

## Step 3: Draft RECOGNIZE Section (20 minutes)

**Goal**: Teach readers to notice energy depletion signals

**Required Components** (from data-model.md):
1. **Name**: **RECOGNIZE the Drain** (bold)
2. **Metaphor**: Phone battery icon turning red (or similar)
3. **Why (Simple Science)**: Brain sends fatigue signals when mental energy depletes
4. **How (Action)**: Pause when you notice [list 3-4 specific signals]
5. **Example**: One-sentence scenario → recognition

**Template**:
```
## Step 1: RECOGNIZE the Drain

Your brain is like a phone battery—it warns you before complete shutdown. [WHY] When mental energy depletes, your brain sends signals: you re-read the same sentence three times, small things irritate you, your shoulders tense up. [HOW] Pause when you notice any of these. This isn't failure; it's data. [EXAMPLE] You realize you've read the same email four times without understanding—that's your signal.
```

**Word Budget**: 75-90 words

**Writing Tips**:
- Bold "RECOGNIZE" on first mention
- Use "like a..." for metaphor (relatable comparison)
- List 3-4 specific, physical signals (not abstract: "you feel off")
- Frame as ACTIVE observation, not judgment
- End with quick example (scenario → recognition moment)

**Validation**:
- [ ] Word count: 75-90 words
- [ ] All 5 components present (name, metaphor, why, how, example)
- [ ] Metaphor uses everyday object (phone, car, etc.)
- [ ] Signals are specific and physical
- [ ] Example is 1 sentence max

**Action**: Draft RECOGNIZE section, validate, move to Step 4

---

## Step 4: Draft RESTORE Section (25 minutes)

**Goal**: Teach 3 science-based, equipment-free recharge techniques

**Required Components** (from data-model.md):
1. **Name**: **RESTORE the Tank** (bold)
2. **Metaphor**: Plugging in your phone (deliberate refueling)
3. **Why (Simple Science)**: Brain needs oxygen and rest to recover; strategic rest delivers both
4. **How (3 Techniques)**:
   - Breathing Reset (physiological sigh)
   - Movement Recharge (10-min walk)
   - Task Switching (mental → physical or vice versa)
5. **Example**: After recognizing → apply technique → result

**Template**:
```
## Step 2: RESTORE the Tank

Think of this as plugging in your phone—deliberate action to refuel. [WHY] Your brain needs oxygen and a break from whatever drained it. [HOW] Choose ONE technique (5-15 minutes):
- **Breathing Reset**: Three slow, deep breaths (double inhale, long exhale)
- **Movement Recharge**: 10-minute walk or stretch
- **Task Switch**: Change from mental work to physical (or vice versa)

[EXAMPLE] After noticing low energy, you step outside for 10 minutes—and return thinking clearly.
```

**Word Budget**: 75-90 words

**Writing Tips**:
- Bold "RESTORE" and technique names
- Emphasize TIME-BOUND (5-15 minutes—critical for recharge vs resign distinction)
- Keep technique descriptions ultra-concise (one line each)
- Show ACTIVE choice ("Choose ONE")
- Example shows before → technique → after (restored state)

**Validation**:
- [ ] Word count: 75-90 words
- [ ] All 5 components present
- [ ] 3 techniques listed (breathing, movement, task-switching)
- [ ] Each technique has time estimate
- [ ] Example shows result (restored thinking/energy)

**Action**: Draft RESTORE section, validate, move to Step 5

---

## Step 5: Draft RETURN Section (20 minutes)

**Goal**: Teach readers to re-engage from restored state (proving recharge works)

**Required Components** (from data-model.md):
1. **Name**: **RETURN to Action** (bold)
2. **Metaphor**: Starting car after refueling (go further than before)
3. **Why (Simple Science)**: Restored energy = better decisions, clearer thinking, faster work
4. **How (Action)**: Pick ONE clear next step (not everything, just one thing)
5. **Example**: After recharge → complete task faster/better than before

**Template**:
```
## Step 3: RETURN to Action

Like starting your car after refueling, you'll go further now. [WHY] Restored energy means clearer thinking and faster work—you accomplish MORE by recharging than pushing through. [HOW] Pick one clear next step: "I'll draft the opening paragraph" or "I'll answer three emails." Not everything, just one thing. [EXAMPLE] After your 10-minute walk, you complete in 30 minutes what was taking two hours.
```

**Word Budget**: 75-90 words

**Writing Tips**:
- Bold "RETURN" on first mention
- Emphasize proof: you accomplish MORE after recharge (not less)
- "Pick ONE thing" mantra (prevents overwhelm)
- Give 2 example next-step statements (concrete, small, achievable)
- Example quantifies improvement (30 min vs 2 hours)

**Validation**:
- [ ] Word count: 75-90 words
- [ ] All 5 components present
- [ ] Metaphor reinforces forward movement
- [ ] "Pick ONE" emphasis clear
- [ ] Example shows measurable improvement

**Action**: Draft RETURN section, validate, move to Step 6

---

## Step 6: Add Recharge vs Resign Distinction (10 minutes)

**Goal**: Clarify the critical difference in 20-25 words

**Required Content** (from data-model.md):
- Recharge = time-bound + intentional
- Resign = indefinite + avoidance

**Template**:
```
**Recharge vs Resign**: Recharge is 10 minutes with a plan to return. Resign is hours of scrolling with no plan at all.
```

**Alternative Templates**:
```
The difference? Recharge has a timer and a purpose. Resign has neither.
```

```
Recharge: "I'll walk for 10 minutes, then tackle this." Resign: "I give up, I'll do it later" (no later planned).
```

**Word Budget**: 20-25 words

**Writing Tips**:
- Bold "Recharge vs Resign" heading or lead-in
- Use contrast structure (Recharge is X. Resign is Y.)
- Emphasize TIME LIMIT as key distinguisher
- Keep ultra-concise (one or two sentences max)

**Validation**:
- [ ] Word count: 20-25 words
- [ ] Time-bound vs indefinite distinction clear
- [ ] Intentional vs avoidance contrast clear
- [ ] Concise (no elaboration needed)

**Action**: Draft distinction, validate, move to Step 7

---

## Step 7: Draft Action Steps (25 minutes)

**Goal**: Provide 3-4 numbered, immediately implementable actions

**Required Content** (from data-model.md):
1. **Right Now**: Apply RECOGNIZE-RESTORE-RETURN to current state
2. **This Week**: Set up system (90-min timers, recharge reminders)
3. **Going Forward**: Track what works, build habit

**Template**:
```
## Your Next Steps

1. **Right Now**: Notice your current energy level. If low, apply one RESTORE technique (breathing, walking, or switching) for 10 minutes, then return to one clear task.

2. **This Week**: Set a timer for 90-minute work blocks. When it goes off, take a 10-minute recharge break—no guilt, just refueling.

3. **Going Forward**: Track which recharge techniques work best for you. Your brain will show you: use what restores your energy fastest.

[Optional 4th action if word budget allows]
4. **Share It**: Teach someone the RECOGNIZE-RESTORE-RETURN framework this week. Teaching it strengthens your own practice.
```

**Word Budget**: 100-150 words

**Writing Tips**:
- Bold step labels ("Right Now", "This Week", "Going Forward")
- Start each action with verb (Notice, Set, Track, Share)
- Be ultra-specific (not "take breaks" but "10-minute walk after 90-minute work block")
- Include implementation details (timers, tracking, sharing)
- Prioritize immediate action (step 1) over long-term habit (step 3)

**Validation**:
- [ ] Word count: 100-150 words
- [ ] 3-4 numbered actions (minimum 3)
- [ ] Each action starts with verb
- [ ] Specific instructions (not vague: "practice this")
- [ ] Implementable within 1 hour (step 1) or this week (steps 2-3)

**Action**: Draft Action Steps, validate, move to Step 8

---

## Step 8: Draft Closing Motivation (10 minutes)

**Goal**: Empower reader's capability in 25-50 words with NO qualifiers

**Required Elements** (from constitution + spec.md FR-011):
- Reinforce capability to manage energy
- Reference framework (RECOGNIZE-RESTORE-RETURN or "recharge")
- Empowering tone, no qualifiers ("maybe", "hopefully", "try to")
- Forward momentum (not just "you can do this" but "you now have...")

**Template Options**:

**Option A (Power Transfer)**:
```
You now have the science-backed power to restore your energy in minutes. RECOGNIZE the drain, RESTORE your tank, RETURN with focus. Recharging isn't weakness—it's your competitive advantage.
```

**Option B (Capability Declaration)**:
```
The energy equation is simple: drain happens, recharge fixes it, action proves it works. You control all three steps. That's power.
```

**Option C (Future-Focused)**:
```
Every time you recharge instead of resign, you're choosing strength over burnout. You have the framework—now you have the energy to use it.
```

**Word Budget**: 25-50 words

**Writing Tips**:
- Avoid qualifiers: "You CAN manage..." → "You MANAGE..."
- Use present tense (not future: "you will be able")
- Reference framework explicitly (RECOGNIZE-RESTORE-RETURN)
- End on strength note ("power", "advantage", "control")
- Short, punchy sentences (no long, complex closings)

**Validation**:
- [ ] Word count: 25-50 words
- [ ] Zero qualifiers ("maybe", "hopefully", "try")
- [ ] Reinforces capability to manage energy
- [ ] References framework
- [ ] Empowering tone (strength, power, control)

**Action**: Draft closing, validate, move to Step 9

---

## Step 9: Validate Against Quality Gates (30 minutes)

**Goal**: Ensure ALL validation gates pass before considering draft complete

### Gate 1: Constitutional Compliance
Open `contracts/energy-equation-schema.md` and check:

- [ ] **Principle I (Tone)**: Every sentence positive/motivational? (checklist 1.1-1.6)
- [ ] **Principle II (Style)**: Grade 7-9 reading level? (test on readable.com)
- [ ] **Principle III (Action)**: All techniques immediately implementable? (checklist 3.1-3.6)
- [ ] **Principle IV (Length)**: Total ≤500 words? (run word count)

### Gate 2: Structural Requirements
- [ ] **S1**: Opening Hook present (50-75w)?
- [ ] **S2**: Core Teaching complete (RECOGNIZE, RESTORE, RETURN with all components)?
- [ ] **S3**: Action Steps numbered (3-4 actions, 100-150w)?
- [ ] **S4**: Closing Motivation empowering (25-50w)?
- [ ] **F1-F6**: Formatting (benefit headings, bold key terms, scannable)?

### Gate 3: Functional Requirements
- [ ] **FR-001 to FR-013**: All functional requirements met? (see spec.md)
- [ ] **SC-001 to SC-009**: Design supports all success criteria? (see spec.md)

**Validation Tools**:
1. Word count: Use text editor count
2. Readability: Paste into readable.com → check Flesch-Kincaid grade
3. Checklist: Use contracts/energy-equation-schema.md full checklist

**If Any Gate Fails**:
- Review failure handling section in contracts/energy-equation-schema.md
- Make edits to address failures
- Re-validate until ALL gates pass

**Action**: Complete validation, fix any failures, move to Step 10

---

## Step 10: Polish & Finalize (30 minutes)

**Goal**: Final editing passes to strengthen clarity, flow, and impact

### Edit Pass 1: Cut Filler Words (10 minutes)
Search and remove:
- "very", "really", "actually", "just", "basically"
- "maybe", "perhaps", "might", "hopefully"
- "kind of", "sort of", "a little bit"

Replace weak constructions:
- "You can try..." → "Apply..."
- "This might help..." → "This restores..."
- "It's really important..." → "Critical:"

### Edit Pass 2: Strengthen Verbs (10 minutes)
Replace weak verbs:
- "is/are/was/were" → action verbs
- "get" → "restore", "achieve", "gain"
- "do" → specific action verb
- "make" → "create", "build", "generate"

Check for active voice:
- ❌ "Energy is restored by breathing" → ✅ "Breathing restores energy"
- ❌ "Breaks can be taken" → ✅ "Take breaks"

### Edit Pass 3: Improve Flow (10 minutes)
**Sentence Variety**:
- Vary sentence length (short punchy + medium explanatory)
- Alternate simple and compound sentences
- Start sentences differently (avoid "You..." every time)

**Paragraph Rhythm**:
- Check 2-4 sentences per paragraph
- Ensure logical flow between ideas
- Add transitions if needed ("Now...", "Here's how...", "After...")

**Read Aloud Test**:
- Read entire chapter aloud
- Mark anywhere you stumble (awkward phrasing)
- Simplify any tongue-twister sentences

### Final Checklist
- [ ] Total word count ≤500 (final check)
- [ ] All filler words removed
- [ ] All verbs strengthened
- [ ] Flow smooth (read-aloud test passed)
- [ ] All 3 gates validated and passed
- [ ] File saved as `content/chapters/02-energy-equation.md`

**Action**: Complete all polish passes, save final file, mark implementation complete

### The 3-Rule Framework (RECOGNIZE-RESTORE-RETURN)

| Rule | Metaphor | Why | How |
|------|----------|-----|-----|
| RECOGNIZE | Phone battery warning | Brain sends depletion signals | Pause when: can't focus, irritated, tense |
| RESTORE | Plugging in to recharge | Brain needs oxygen and rest | Choose 1: breathing, walking, task-switch (5-15 min) |
| RETURN | Starting car after refuel | Restored energy = faster work | Pick ONE next step and do it |

## Troubleshooting

### "I'm Over 500 Words"
1. Remove filler words first (usually saves 20-30 words)
2. Shorten examples (1 sentence each max)
3. Merge redundant points
4. Cut "nice to have" explanations (keep only essential)
5. Prioritize techniques over theory

### "It Sounds Too Academic"
1. Replace jargon with analogies (phone battery, refueling car)
2. Shorten sentences (12-15 word average)
3. Use "you" language (direct address)
4. Test on hemingwayapp.com (target: grade 8)

### "The Sections Don't Flow"
1. Add transitions ("Now that you recognize...", "After restoring...")
2. Reference previous sections ("Remember that battery warning?")
3. Use consistent metaphor language throughout

### "I'm Not Sure It's Empowering Enough"
1. Check for qualifiers and remove ("might" → "will")
2. Use stronger verbs ("have" → "control", "can" → direct command)
3. Frame rest as STRENGTH (not permission)
4. End sections with capability statements
